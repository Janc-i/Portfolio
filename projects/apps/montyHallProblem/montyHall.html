        The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show. The
        contestant is given three doors, behind one of which is a prize, while
        the other two doors hide nothing. The contestant chooses a door, but
        before it is opened, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens
        one of the other two doors, revealing that there is nothing behind it.
        The contestant is then given the option to switch their choice to the
        other unopened door or stick with their original choice. The question
        is: Should the contestant switch their choice to the other door to
        increase their chances of winning the prize?
